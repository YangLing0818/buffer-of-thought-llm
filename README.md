## Introduction

We introduce **BoT**, a novel and versatile thought-augmented reasoning approach designed to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose a **meta-buffer** to store a series of high-level thoughts, referred to as **thought-templates**, distilled from problem-solving processes across various tasks. For each problem, we retrieve a relevant thought-template and adaptively instantiate it with specific reasoning structures to conduct efficient reasoning. To ensure scalability and stability, we also propose a **buffer-manager** to dynamically update the meta-buffer, thus enhancing its capacity as more tasks are solved. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, achieving significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: 11% on Game of 24, 20% on Geometric Shapes, and 51% on Checkmate-in-One. Further analysis demonstrates the superior generalization ability and robustness of our BoT, while requiring only 12% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods (e.g., tree/graph of thoughts) on average. Notably, we find that our **Llama3-8B + BoT has the potential to surpass Llama3-70B** model.

## Evaluation with Buffer of Thoughts

### 1. Benchmarks 

For now, we release our demo version of BoT based on three different benchmarks:

- **The Game of 24** from [Yao et al., 2023](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm)
- **Checkmate-in-One** from [the BIG-Bench suite](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main) [(BIG-Bench authors, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615)
- **Word Sorting** from [BIG-Bench Hard](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard) ([Suzgun et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261); [BIG-Bench authors, 2023](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main))

### 2. Meta Buffer

For each task, we choose one thought template sampled from our meta-buffer library. **Stay tuned for our complete meta-buffer library update!**

### 3. Quick Start

First, set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YangLing0818/buffer-of-thought-llm
cd buffer-of-thought-llm
conda create -n BoT python==3.9
conda activate BoT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3.1. Running on Three Benchmarks

Our BoT is easy to use. Just run:

```bash
python run_benchmarks.py --task_name 'gameof24' --api_key 'input your API key here if you want to use GPT-4' --model_id 'the model ID of GPT-4 or the path to your local LLM'
```

Here, **--task_name** could be one of gameof24, checkmate, wordsorting.

The **--api_key** is required if you want to use GPT-series; if not, you can skip it.

The **--model_id** should be the model ID of GPT-series like gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, or the path to your local LLM if you do not set **--api_key**.

The data for these three tasks are located in the `/benchmarks` directory.

The results generated during the experiment are stored in the `/test_results` directory.

#### 3.2. Validate the Test Results

Run the command below to validate the test results of our BoT:

```python
python validate_results.py --task_name 'gameof24' --test_path 'The path to the .jsonl file you want to validate'
```

This will print out the accuracy of the selected task on your relevant .jsonl file.
